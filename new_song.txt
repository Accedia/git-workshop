toring Credentials in Config

The AWS CLI will also read credentials from the config file. If you want to keep all of your profile settings in a single file, you can. If there are ever credentials in both locations for a profile (say you used aws configure to update the profile's keys), the keys in the credentials file will take precedence.

If you use one of the SDKs in addition to the AWS CLI, you may notice additional warnings if credentials are not stored in their own file.
